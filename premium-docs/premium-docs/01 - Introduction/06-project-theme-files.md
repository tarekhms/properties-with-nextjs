# Project Theme Files

Before we start our project, I want to go over a few things. This is the Github Repo for the final project. You can always find the latest code here. What I want to point out is the `_theme_files` folder. This is the HTML/CSS/Tailwind version of the project. It's all the markup and styling. Just no functionality. Obviously, we'll be adding the functionality with Next.js and a bunch of other technologies.

The reason that I have the theme files for you is so that we don't have to type out all of the HTML and Tailwind classes from scratch. This is not a Tailwind course. I do have a 10 project Tailwind course that you can check out if you want to learn more about Tailwind. But for this course, we're going to be focusing on Next.js and the functionality of the project. However, I do like my course projects to look nice, so there are quite a bit of classes. So there will be points where we copy the HTML from the theme files, paste it into our project and then create components, add the functionality and make it work.

I know some of you don't like the copying and pasting, but I think having to type out all of the HTML and Tailwind classes would be a waste of time and very tedious. So I hope you understand why I'm doing it this way. I think it's a good balance between getting the project done and making it look nice. It also relates more to real-world projects where you might be given a design and you have to implement it.

So what I would suggest doing is either opening the theme files within another editor or other editor window, or just add the folder right to your project, which is what I'm going to do when we create our project files. So that way I can easily open the HTML version of the page for quick reference.
